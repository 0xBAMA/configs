# conkyrc-crt-configs
my default conky config, my default cool-retro-term config, my default vim config

the crt config is set up to be mildly transparent, and the relevant parts of the conky are ffffff, so they shine through

the conky runs a lua script to spell out the time, i.e. 'quarter to four', stuff like that
